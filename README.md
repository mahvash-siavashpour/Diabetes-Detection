# Diabetes-Detection
The goal of this project was to detect Diabetes using XGBoost based on the information of more than 70,000 patients through the questionnaire that they filled out for the Organization for Disease Control and Prevention.

## Project Description
In this project a Diabetes detection model has been constructed using XGBoost or Extreme Gradient Boost, which is an open source library used for parallel tree boosting. After construnction the model, it is trained on the information of more than 70,000 patients through the questionnaire that they filled out for the Organization for Disease Control and Prevention.
## Dataset
The data used in this project is the information of more than 70,000 patients through the questionnaire that they filled out for the Organization for Disease Control and Prevention. The dataset contains 22 columns as described bellow:
